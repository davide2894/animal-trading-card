#Animal Trading Card

This is a card made with HTML an CSS and is part of the Front-End Web Developer nanodegree program at Udacity.

## Requirements
As per the [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/151/view), the card must reflect the following requirements:

* The text is italicized for the animal’s interesting fact.
* The labels are bolded for the animal’s list items.
* The dots are removed from the animal's list items.
* Uses border around animal’s name, image, and information (interesting fact, list items, and description).
* Uses border around animal’s information.
* Uses spacing between animal’s name, image, and information.
* Card width should be fixed and include the spacing around the image (Since image is 300px wide, card should be 300px + spacing on either side. Card should not expand with the browser window).

After meeting these requirements, I personalized it a bit, check it out if you want, every feedback is more than welcome!
